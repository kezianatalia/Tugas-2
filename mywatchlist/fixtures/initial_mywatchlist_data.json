It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own."

            "review": "Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking."

A film should make sense whether you are a big fan or a novice. I like Marvel but I'm a casual viewer. I don't want to watch a film where it's like, you need to watch film 23 and episode 9 of season 1 to understand the plot. Loved the first film too. This is literally madness."
